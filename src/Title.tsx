        I've compared over <b>150 phones</b> in total, and around 35 of those
        phones were <b>under $50</b>. So if you're looking for extremely cheap
        phones, which are phones under $50, you came to the right place.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here I've compiled a list of 6 phones that I would consider to be the best
        budget phones under $50. All these phones are the best in terms of specs
        while being close to or around under $50. So I let you know these
        phones exist and that will give you the best bang for you buck! 
        <br />
        <br/>
        Since we are going extreme budget mode, the best deals we could get are at <b>EBAY!</b>
